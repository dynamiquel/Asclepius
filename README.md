# Asclepius
A simple replicated health system for Unreal Engine. Forked from an early build of [Abstruse](https://vixentail.com/abstruse).

**C++ and Blueprint**

## Bone Models
This system uses a concept called 'bone models', where designers can easily apply damage multiplications depending on which bones were damaged.
